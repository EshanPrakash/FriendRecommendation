# FriendRecommendation
A Friend Recommendation project in collaboration with Lucy Brodsky.

This code contains an algorithm with three functions:

1. Find another user that is the most similar to the specified user, based on the Jaccard index of their friends.
2. Out of the most-similar-user's friends, find the one with the most followers that the specified user does not already follow.
3. Take that user, and recommend them as a friend to the specified user
